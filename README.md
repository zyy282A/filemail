# Filemail Secure File Sharing: Send Files Up to 5GB Free, Fast Transfer Speeds, Professional Cloud Storage

Ever tried emailing a video file only to hit that dreaded "attachment too large" message? Yeah, we've all been there. That's where Filemail comes in—it's like giving your files a private jet instead of cramming them into coach.

## What Makes Filemail Different From Other File Sharing Services

Filemail isn't trying to be everything to everyone. It does one thing really well: lets you send massive files without the usual headaches. Since 2008, they've been helping people move everything from high-resolution video projects to massive design portfolios without breaking a sweat.

The free version gets you 5GB per transfer, which honestly covers most situations. But here's the thing—if you're regularly moving bigger files or need features like password protection and permanent storage, their paid plans make a lot of sense.

## How Filemail Actually Works (It's Pretty Simple)

Using Filemail feels more like sending an email than wrestling with complicated software. You drag and drop your files, type in the recipient's email, and hit send. That's it. No account creation required for basic use, no software installation for recipients to download files.

Your files get uploaded to Filemail's secure cloud servers, and recipients get an email with a download link. They click, they download, done. The interface doesn't try to impress you with fancy animations—it just gets out of your way and does the job.

## Filemail Pricing Plans: What You Actually Get

| Plan | Monthly Price | Annual Price (Save 16%) | Max Transfer Size | Storage | Best For |

| **Basic** | Free | Free | 5 GB | N/A | Occasional file sharing, trying out the service |
| **Personal** | Not listed | Not listed | 5 GB | 250 GB | Individual users who need basic tracking and management |
| **Pro** | Not listed | $10/month | 250 GB | 1 TB | Freelancers and professionals with regular large file transfers |

The yearly billing gets you roughly two months free compared to paying monthly. If you're doing this professionally, that's basically found money.

## Features That Actually Matter

**Speed**: Filemail uses UDP transfer acceleration on their desktop apps, which can hit speeds up to 200 times faster than browser-based transfers. In real-world terms, that massive 50GB video project might finish uploading before your coffee gets cold.

**Security**: All files get scanned for viruses, transfers are encrypted with TLS-1.2 (AES-256), and you can add password protection on paid plans. Business and Enterprise plans get end-to-end encryption and two-factor authentication. They've been operating since 2008 with zero data breaches—not a bad track record.

**Custom Branding**: Pro and higher plans let you customize everything with your logo, colors, and custom subdomain. Your clients see your brand, not Filemail's. It's a nice touch that makes you look more professional.

**File Tracking**: You get notifications when files are downloaded, can see who accessed what and when, and can extend expiration dates if needed. It's simple activity tracking that actually comes in handy.

## Who's Using Filemail and What They're Saying

People in video production, photography, architecture, and design seem to love it. One user in the NGO sector called it "a perfect equivalent for much more expensive data transfer solutions." Another freelancer mentioned they've used it for 4+ years "with no bugs or any issues."

The main complaint? Download speeds can sometimes slow down, particularly during peak times. Some users on Trustpilot reported frustratingly slow transfers compared to other services. It's worth noting this seems inconsistent—many others praise the speed.

A few users wish the free plan included password protection (currently only on paid plans), and there are occasional mentions that compared to pure storage services like Dropbox, the storage-to-price ratio isn't as generous. Fair points, though Filemail is optimized for transfers, not long-term storage.

## Apps for Every Platform

Filemail has native apps for Windows, Mac, Linux, iPhone, iPad, and Android. There's also an Outlook add-in that lets you send large files right from your email client. If you don't want to install anything, the web interface works fine too.

The desktop apps give you better performance with that UDP acceleration we mentioned, plus you can resume interrupted transfers and set up automatic downloads for incoming files.

## Is Filemail Right for You?

**You'll probably like Filemail if:**
- You regularly send files that are too big for email
- You need a straightforward solution without a learning curve
- You want recipients to download files without creating accounts
- You're working with clients who need branded download pages
- You need compliance features for regulated industries

**You might want to look elsewhere if:**
- You mainly need long-term cloud storage rather than file transfers
- You're extremely price-sensitive and need the absolute cheapest option
- You need extensive collaboration features like real-time editing
- Consistent ultra-fast download speeds are non-negotiable for your workflow

## The Bottom Line

Filemail does file transfers well and doesn't pretend to be a full-fledged cloud storage ecosystem. It's reliable, secure, and refreshingly straightforward. The free tier is genuinely useful, and the paid plans offer enough value to justify the cost if you're doing this professionally.

Is it perfect? No. The occasional speed complaints are real, and some competitors offer more storage for the money. But for many users, the simplicity and reliability outweigh those concerns.
